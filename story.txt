There was once a bird named Eigo. He was a very sad bird for he couldn't fly. Eigo pitter pattered all over town trying to find his next meal of old-people crumbs, but was too slow and always got the scraps that the other bluejays had discarded. One morning, Eigo saw a mysterious light that flashed across the sky with such intensity that his eyes burned while desperately squinting. He stumbled over to where he thought it had landed, and looked over the edge to something that would change his life forever. Looking at the beautiful light Eigo began to question his past life decisions. He wondered if with this new outlook everything would change. He began to trudge forward to the light. 
He decided to dive into his journey of self-exploration. What better way to do it than to take on yoga? The next day he enrolled in a yoga class in a studio down the block. He decided to push his boundaries a bit and try hot yoga. He entered the room, and discovered the room was extremely hot. Eigo's yoga instructor began to toss spices on him. Eigo slowly came to the realization...his instructor was trying to cook him! How terrible! Eigo began to look for a way out. Just then, he saw the mysterious light again. One of the old people who fed him special crumbs tossed open the door and shouted to Eigo "get out of the oven". The walls were getting hotter and hotter and Eigo jumped into the old woman's hands. She ran out of the house and was able to put Eigo back in his colony where he thought about how living a broken life is actually just his own special life from which no one can experience. From then on, with a chip on his shoulder, Eigo strutted proudly around.
